                Your nutrition is the most important part of your new journey.
                Plans should be sustainable and enjoyable. I want to help you to
                make lifestyle changes rather than simply adhering to boring or
                strict diets! To achieve the desired results, it is important to
                create a healthy balance between having a good relationship with
                food and understanding what you must pay attention to (i.e.
                portion sizes, calories, macros). Also, we will facilitate any
                allergies or dietary restrictions you might have (i.e. coeliac,
                lactose intolerant or vegan).

                You can track all progress and measurements through my app on
                your phone. This includes photos, body measurements, weigh-ins,
                diet or water intake. That way, I can monitor your progress and
                make any necessary adjustments to your goals or plans.

                Of course, you can! I can create a plan around your preferred
                location and fit around your goals and lifestyle.

                You decide how much time per week you have for training and your
                goal. Together we will make a plan so that exercising fits into
                your routine in the best possible way.

                Everyoneâ€™s body reacts and adapts to exercise differently so
                that we will work with you at the best pace for you. The
                training will be broken down into phases of 6 weeks to ensure
                you progress towards your goals and training at the right
                intensity. For the first part of the program, you will commit to
                at least 12 weeks to ensure we can obtain noticeable progress. I
                have had some clients achieve the results theyâ€™ve wanted in a
                matter of weeks, some in a matter of months â€“ both dropping vast
                amounts of body fat, but all at different rates. Results depend
                on numerous factors like your tailored nutrition and workout
                plans, commitment in- and outside the gym and how much work you
                put in. If you are willing to commit fully, I can guarantee that
                you will make progress. You do not have to be perfect; just be
                better than you are now.
